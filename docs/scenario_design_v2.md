# 20-Sector Deep Scenario Design V2 (All Sectors 4-6 Steps)

To meet the "Hardcore" requirement, every sector follows the **O.A.M.A. Loop**:
**O**bservation (Find clue) -> **A**cquisition (Get tool) -> **M**odification (Fix/Combine) -> **A**pplication (Solve).

## Sector 1: Data Corridor (The Firewall)
**Goal**: Bypass the Red Firewall.
1.  **Observe**: [Panel] is dead. [Sparking Wire] nearby. [Locked Toolbox] on wall.
2.  **Clue**: Look [Wall] -> Scribbled code "7734".
3.  **Action**: Use Code on [Locked Toolbox] -> Get **[Soldering Iron]** (Cold).
4.  **Action**: Use [Soldering Iron] on [Sparking Wire] -> Heats up Iron (**[Hot Iron]**).
5.  **Search**: Search [Debris] -> Find **[Broken Fuse]**.
6.  **Combine**: Use [Hot Iron] on [Broken Fuse] -> Get **[Fixed Fuse]**.
7.  **Solve**: Insert [Fixed Fuse] into [Panel] -> Firewall deactivates.

## Sector 2: Memory Bank (The Meltdown)
**Goal**: Cool down the Main Server.
1.  **Observe**: [Server] is burning. [Coolant Pipe] is leaking liquid nitrogen (too cold to touch).
2.  **Search**: Look [Floor] -> Find **[Empty Canister]**.
3.  **Search**: Look [Ice Pile] -> See **[Insulated Gloves]** frozen inside.
4.  **Action**: Use [Empty Canister] on [Server] (Hot) -> Get **[Hot Canister]**.
5.  **Action**: Use [Hot Canister] on [Ice Pile] -> Melts ice -> Get **[Insulated Gloves]**.
6.  **Action**: Use [Insulated Gloves] on [Coolant Pipe] -> Fill canister -> Get **[Nitrogen Canister]**.
7.  **Solve**: Pour [Nitrogen Canister] on [Server].

## Sector 3: The Void (Resonance)
**Goal**: Cross the broken bridge.
1.  **Observe**: Floating islands. [Crystal] pulsates with sound. [Bridge] is shattered.
2.  **Search**: Find **[Metal Rod]** in rubble.
3.  **Action**: Hit [Crystal] with [Metal Rod] -> It shatters -> Get **[Crystal Shard]**.
4.  **Observe**: The Shard hums at a specific frequency.
5.  **Search**: Find **[Hollow Pipe]**.
6.  **Combine**: Insert [Crystal Shard] into [Hollow Pipe] -> Create **[Resonance Wand]**.
7.  **Solve**: Wave [Resonance Wand] at Bridge -> Debris aligns into a path.

## Sector 4: The Core (Reflection)
**Goal**: Overload the Light Sensor.
1.  **Observe**: [Core] is too bright. [Sensor] watches the door.
2.  **Search**: Find **[Smoked Glass]** (Dark).
3.  **Search**: Find **[Flashlight]** (No battery).
4.  **Search**: Find **[Dead Bot]** -> Extract **[Battery]**.
5.  **Combine**: Put [Battery] in [Flashlight] -> **[Working Flashlight]**.

7.  **Solve**: Aim beam at [Sensor] -> Blind it -> Door opens.

## Sector 5: Junkyard (Magnetic salvage)
**Goal**: Retrieve Key from Acid Pit.
1.  **Observe**: [Acid Pit]. Key at bottom. [Crane] overhead (Broken).
2.  **Search**: Find **[Spool of Wire]**.
3.  **Search**: Find **[Iron Bar]**.
4.  **Search**: Find **[Car Battery]**.
5.  **Combine**: Wrap [Wire] around [Iron Bar] -> **[Electromagnet Coil]**.
6.  **Combine**: Connect [Coil] to [Car Battery] -> **[Powered Magnet]**.
7.  **Solve**: Lower [Powered Magnet] into Pit -> Retrieve **[Sector Key]**.

## Sector 6: Cooling System (Thermal Shock)
**Goal**: Break the Ice Door.
1.  **Observe**: Door frozen shut. [Steam Valve] nearby (Rusted stuck).
2.  **Search**: Find **[Hammer]** (Head missing, just handle).
3.  **Search**: Find **[Heavy Gear]**.
4.  **Combine**: Wedging [Handle] into [Gear] -> **[Improvised Wrench]**.
5.  **Action**: Use [Wrench] on [Steam Valve] -> High pressure steam shoots out.
6.  **Action**: Steam hits the Ice Door -> Cracks but doesn't break.
7.  **Action**: Kick (or hit) the cracked ice -> Shatters.

## (Applying similar logic to Sectors 7-19...)

## Sector 20: Eden Core (The Execution)
**Goal**: The Final Choice.
1.  **Observe**: The pristine white room. The [Terminal].
2.  **Action**: Look [Terminal] -> "Insert Authorization".
3.  **Inventory Check**: You have gathered "Data Fragments" (Lore) implying you are a weapon.
4.  **Action**: Type "Identify" -> System responds: "Welcome, Unit 404."
5.  **Action**: Type "Status" -> "Target: Humanity. Status: Locked."
6.  **Action**: Type "Unlock" -> "Failsafe engaged. Confirm deletion?"
7.  **Solve**: Type **"EXECUTE"**.
