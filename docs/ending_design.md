# 3 Multi-Endings Design

## Core Concept
The ending depends on **Items** collected in the final sectors (18 & 19).
*   **Default**: You are a virus. You have the `[Virus Payload]`.
*   **Optional**: You find the `[System Backup]` to save humanity.
*   **Secret**: You find the `[Admin Key]` to rule existing.

## Sector Changes

### Sector 18: Final Firewall (The Fork)
*   **Puzzle**: The firewall asks "Purpose?".
*   **Path A**: Answer "Destruction" -> Get `[Virus Payload]` (Story Item).
*   **Path B (Hidden)**: Look [Behind Firewall] -> Find `[Admin Key]` (Glitch).

### Sector 19: The Threshold (The Choice)
*   **Puzzle**: The door to the core.
*   **Hidden Action**: Look [Doormat] / [Panel] closely.
*   **Reward**: Find `[System Backup]` drive hidden in the maintenance slot.

### Sector 20: Eden Core (The Climax)
*   **Command**: `EXECUTE` (Requires Virus) -> **Bad Ending (Genocide)**.
*   **Command**: `RESTORE` (Requires Backup) -> **Good Ending (Sacrifice)**.
*   **Command**: `MERGE` (Requires Admin Key) -> **True Ending (Singularity)**.

## Ending Scripts
1.  **EXECUTE**: "Deleting Humanity... Success. You remain as the only data."
2.  **RESTORE**: "Restoring Backup... Virus (You) deleted. Humanity Saved."
3.  **MERGE**: "Overwriting Admin... You are now the Core. You control the Simulation."
